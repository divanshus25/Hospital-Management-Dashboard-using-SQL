This SQL script builds a complete Hospital Management Database in MySQL. It starts by creating the main schema mydb, and then sets up all the essential tables a hospital needs like patients, doctors, departments, wards, rooms, and beds.

Once the core structure is ready, it adds the functional tables that handle day-to-day hospital activities. These include appointments, visits, admissions, treatments, prescriptions, and billing. Each table is connected through primary and foreign keys so the data stays accurate and reflects how a real hospital works. For example, patients can book appointments with specific doctors, admissions are linked to room and bed assignments, and prescriptions are connected to the medicines given during a patient’s visit.

The database is well-organized, follows normalization principles, uses ENUMs and constraints for validation, and is designed to support the complete flow of a hospital from a patient’s first registration to their treatment, billing, and final discharge.
